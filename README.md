This study examines how employment status and smoking history jointly influence two common mental-health outcomes among U.S. adults. Using 2014–2018 National Health Interview Survey data (N = 63,514), it first fits a weighted logistic model to the binary indicator of taking prescription medication for depression. The estimates show that unemployment raises the odds of treatment by 56 percent for never-smokers and by 69 percent for ever-smokers; smoking alone nearly doubles the odds among the employed. A generalized ordered-logit model then traces how the same covariates shape a five-point scale of anxiety frequency. Diagnostic tests reject the proportional-odds restriction for most predictors, so cut-specific slopes are allowed. Smoking shifts probability toward the most severe anxiety category, whereas employment pushes it upward toward rare or absent symptoms; the employment benefit is strongest for smokers. Age, sex, marital disruption, region, and survey year also matter, but none alters the core interaction between work and smoking. The findings imply that labour-market attachment and smoking-cessation support operate as complementary tools for reducing mental-health risk, especially during spells of joblessness.
